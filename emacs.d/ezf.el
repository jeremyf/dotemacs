;;; Commentary:

;; Filter and select matches on the command line using your favourite
;; completion framework in Emacs.  It's an Emacs version of `fzf', a
;; command line tool that does basic fuzzy finding and selection using
;; a curses-like program.
;;
;; Unlike `fzf' this package + a shell script uses your Emacs instead!
;; That means it works well in `shell-mode' -- or equally well in
;; internal or external terminals -- and with the benefit of calling
;; out to your existing Emacs instance using `emacsclient'.
;;
;; Pipe data into `ezf' and you'll be prompted to filter and select
;; from the candidates in Emacs.
;;

;;; Examples:

;;
;;    # Search for debian packages and pass the matches to `ezf'
;;    $ apt-cache search emacs | ezf -f 1
;;
;;    # Filter matches from `find' and pass them to `wc'
;;    $ wc -l $(find . -name '*.txt' | ezf)
;;
