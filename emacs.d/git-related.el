;;; Commentary:

;; Find files by recommendation based on git commit history.

;; Usage: Visiting a git versioned file run once (and then only when
;; you feel the need to refresh) `consult-git-related-update' than you will get
;; suggestions based on the current file through invocations to
;; `consult-git-related-find-file'

;;; Todo:

;; Test that the graph exists, if not, run the command for the graph then
;; proceed.
